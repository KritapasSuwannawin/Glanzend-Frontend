# Gl√§nzend Frontend

Gl√§nzend Frontend is an e-commerce jewelry online store that can be accessed at https://glanzend.netlify.app. This project relies on APIs provided by [Gl√§nzend Backend](https://github.com/KritapasSuwannawin/Glanzend-Backend), a RESTful API server that serves as the backend for the website.

Please note that this project is a personal project and is not intended for real online jewelry orders, although it may appear very realistic. üòâ

## Tech Stack

Key libraries that this project uses include:

- ReactJS, a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces.
- React Router, a routing library for React that provides a way to navigate between different components of the application.
- Redux Toolkit, a set of tools built on top of the Redux state management library that simplifies common Redux use cases.
- React Transition Group, a React library used for managing component states during mount and unmount transitions.

## Status

Gl√§nzend Frontend is currently up and running; however, there are several areas for improvement as stated in the [Roadmap](#roadmap) below.

## Acknowledgment

Ms. Yanisa Bhisitcharoentat is the creative force behind the user interface of this project. Her design file can be accessed on Figma at [Gl√§nzend UI](https://www.figma.com/file/VIFBsk5SgSsF2Kbosb3m1V/Jewelry-E-commerce-website?node-id=0%3A1&t=R2NLSQJiODJUNABo-1).

## Roadmap

My future plan for this project primarily involves adding new features to the website, including but not limited to:

- Implementing social sign-up and login.
- Integrating Stripe for online payment.
- Enabling users to reset their password.
